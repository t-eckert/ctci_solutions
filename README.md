# Cracking the Coding Interview Solutions

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/t-eckert/ctci_solutions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/t-eckert/ctci_solutions)

Personal solutions to Gayle McDowell's "[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)".

I began these solutions when I was preparring for my first job in software. Since working in the field, I've learned so much about [TDD](https://technologyconversations.com/2013/12/20/test-driven-development-tdd-example-walkthrough/) and how to design a better repository. I come back to this work periodically to hone my skills and give others more resources for learning. Please feel free to open issues if you have any questions.
